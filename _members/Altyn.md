I received my B.Sc. degree in Big Data Analysis from Astana IT University, Kazakhstan, in 2022. I am currently an M.S. student at the Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence, Chonnam National University, South Korea, starting in Fall 2023. I joined the Pattern Recognition Laboratory in November 2025, and my research interests include student burnout prediction, physiological and behavioral pattern analysis, multimodal learning, and machine learning for well-being estimation.
