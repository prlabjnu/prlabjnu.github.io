I obtained an engineering degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from Vietnam Aviation Academy. 

I am currently pursuing my masterâ€™s degree at the Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence, Chonnam National University, South Korea, and I joined the Pattern Recognition Lab in September 2024.
