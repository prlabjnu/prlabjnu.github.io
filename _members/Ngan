I received my B.S. degree from the Department of Mathematics and Computer, HCM University of Science, Viet Nam in 2020. I joined the Pattern Recognition Lab in March 2021 and received my M.S. 
degree from the Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence, Chonnam National University, South Korea in 2023. In March 2024, I rejoined the department of Artificial Intelligence at Chonnam National University to pursue my PhD degree. My research is focused on textual and physiological signal-based emotion
recognition. I am also interested in studying deep generative models.
