I obtained my BSc degree from the Department of Control Engineering and Automation, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Viet Nam in 2022.
I am currently pursuing my masterâ€™s degree at the Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence, Chonnam National University, South Korea, and I joined the Pattern Recognition Lab in March 2023.
My research interest is in medical image analysis and pattern recognition.
