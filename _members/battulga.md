I earned my BSc and MSc degrees from the Department of Electronics, Mongolian University of Science and Technology. Currently, I am pursuing an MSc at the Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence, Chonnam National University, and I joined the Pattern Recognition Lab in September 2023.
My research interest is in image processing and pattern recognition.
