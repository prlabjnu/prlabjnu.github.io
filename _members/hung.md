I earned my BSc degree in Computer Vision from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Science in 2023 and subsequently gained two years of experience as an AI Engineer at FPT Software. 
I am currently an MSc student at the department of AI Convergence, Chonnam National University, and I joined the Pattern Recognition Lab (PRLab) in September 2025. My primary research topic is machine reading.
