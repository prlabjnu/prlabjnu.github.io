I received my B.Sc. degree from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Mkar, Nigeria, in 2019. I am currently an integrated M.S./Ph.D. student at the Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence, at Chonnam National University, South Korea. I joined the Pattern Recognition Laboratory in March 2022, and my research interests include depression intensity and treatment outcome estimation, emotion inference, an patter recognition.
