I received my B.S. degree from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Mkar, Nigeria, in 2019. I am currently an integrated M.S./Ph.D. student with the Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence at Chonnam National University, South Korea. I joined the Pattern Recognition Laboratory in March 2022, and my research interests include depression intensity and treatment outcome estimation, emotion inference, and pattern recognition.
