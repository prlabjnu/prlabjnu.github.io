I received my B.S. degree in Information and Communication Engineering (with an Energy–AI Convergence minor) from Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea, in 2025.
I am currently pursuing an M.S. degree in the Department of Artificial Intelligence Convergence at Chonnam National University and joined the Pattern Recognition Laboratory (PRLab) in October 2025.
My research interests include multimodal deep learning for emotion and medical data analysis, particularly focusing on depression and anxiety recognition.
