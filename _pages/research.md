## Medical Image Analysis

> Here are some topics that we are working on:
* Clinics/PET/CT – Survival.
* Pathomics – Survival Analysis.
* Treatment Recommendation.
* Difference analysis from PET.
* Rapid Response System (RRS).

## Multimodal Emotion

> Here are some topics that we are working on:
* Cognitive load, concentration recognition with image and/or biological signals (EEG, ECG, EMG, ...).
* Graph-based contextual emotion recognition: video-based (spatial context, _temporal context_).
* Wearable-device based complex emotion recognition: biological signals (EEG, ECG, EMG, ...).
